  - sensor:

    # Current Power Import from Grid / Export to Grid
    # The sensor name used here is for the GoodWe integration using an EH inverter
    # which provides values in watts.

    # Instructions: 
    # Rewrite the state of these sensors to work with your inverter to return a
    # positive value in kW for grid import power and grid export power.

    # correctionFactor is a multiplier to adjust your inverter's power values so
    # they are close to the power values provided by your smart meter to Amber
    # Electric. Start with a value of 1.00 and adjust it when you have a few days
    # of data to compare with Amber's usage data.
